##Day Five

#simulation
	the imitation of the operation of a real world process or system over time. The act of simulating requires modeling first

#Why simulation
	simulation is in life cycle of a product
		#circuit design
		 mechanical parts
		 automobile
		#simulation for products testing
		#training, testing, experimenting

#Modeling and simulating a physical device
	#motion:
		kinematics ==> concerns only the motion
		dynamics ==> takes into account the force that cause motion

#Holonomic and non-holonoomic drive
	holonomic ==> cars
	non-holonomic ==> omni wheel

#differential steering system
	the differential drive ==> hamster
