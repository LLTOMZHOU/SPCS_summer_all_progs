##Machine learning and task level robotics at Autodesk

#task level adaptability
	sensing the environment ==> interpret signals
	closing the loop with inference
	robust level adaptability simplifies robot programming

#Machine learning
	object recognize
	....

#Neural networks ==> making models
	#every neuron
		1.Weight
		2.Sum & Bias
		3.Activation ==> model non-linear relationships

	#more neurons ==> more complex models

	#training neural networks
		1.compare the ground truth with the actual outcomes ==> calculate the errors
		2.try different weights and bias (parameters)  ==> approach the actual truth
		3.gradient descent ==> adjust the parameters faster
		4.generalization ==> avoid overfitting, by using some data for testing the model

	#Labeled data < unlabeled(without associated results)
		==> unsupervised learning ==> try to categorize the unlabeled data and use existing labels


#Task level assembly using machine learning

#Use simulations (in 3D) to train neural networks
	run many instances at the same time ==> save time
	#problem: sensors sometimes catch noise, while data from simulations are really clean
		==>manually add noise to the data from simulations
